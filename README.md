# One Data Science Programme

One Data Science Programme is a 3-week data science workshop aimed for A-Level students.

Students get to have hands-on experience with data wrangling, visualisation and basic statistics without having to install or configure any data science software on their computers. 

This repository contains the materials we use throughout the three weeks.
