# Week 2 tasks

Before you start, make sure you have installed and loaded the following libraries:
"RCurl", "dplyr", "magrittr", and "ggplot2" and load the dataset "Hogwarts_enrolment_data.csv".
 

Task 1: Calculate the statistics (median, mean, quartiles) of the Muggle Studies grade for population of Slytherin. 
# Hint: Use summary function: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/summary 
 
 
Task 2: Calculate the number of individuals left/right best handed in each of Hogwarts House 
# Hint: use count operation (https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html) 
 
Task 3: Use a bar plot chart to present the number of individuals in each of the Hogwarts Houses. 
 

Task 4: The code below generates a scatterplot showing the relationship between scores of History of Magic versus Divination. It uses ggplot2 library, geom_point() (ref: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-scatter-plots-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization) 
 
 
ggplot(data, aes(x=History.of.Magic, y=Divination)) + geom_point() 
 
 a) Run the code above to generate the scatterplot. 
 
 b) Alter the previous graph, by coloring the points according to the student's House.
